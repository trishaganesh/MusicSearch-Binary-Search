# MusicSearch-Binary-Search
This program creates several binary search methods and performs the searches using a collection of music.


The purpose of this program is to understand how Binary Search works. This project is an extension of our previous program (8.01), 
where we needed to understand sequential search. For this project, we were asked to create a music playlist with 10 music objects, 
and we needed to use various search methods to display the results of our program after it is run. 
Linear Print methods and binary methods were utilized.

Area for improvement: 
Initially, I struggled to understand how I could use the linearPrint method in my program as it was confusing to learn. 
However, I was able to understand eventually. 

What I liked: 
I enjoyed understanding how binary search works. It is a bit more involved than sequential search as we 
needed to utilize several concepts taught previously into 1 program.
